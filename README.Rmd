# blotmat: Blotting matrices since 2016

This package does one thing: create symmetric matrices from asymmetric matrices.
It is inspired by [This tweet](https://twitter.com/algaebarnacle/status/713103252582064128).


## How do I use it?

There is only one function called `blot()`:

```{r}
library("blotmat")
mat <- matrix(sample(c(NA, 1), 100, replace = TRUE), 10, 10)
diag(mat) <- 0
mat
isSymmetric(mat)
blot(mat)
isSymmetric(blot(mat))
```
