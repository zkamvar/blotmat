# blotr: Blotting matrices since 2016

This package does one thing: create symmetric matrices from asymmetric matrices.
It is inspired by [This
tweet](https://twitter.com/algaebarnacle/status/713103252582064128).

The basic idea is that you fold your matrix across the diagonal to create a 
symmetric matrix like an inkblot for a [Rorschach
test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test).

## How do I use it?

There is only one function called `blot()`:

```{r}
library("blotr")
set.seed(20160325)
mat <- matrix(sample(c(NA, 1), 100, replace = TRUE), 10, 10)
diag(mat) <- 0
mat
isSymmetric(mat)
```

The matrix is non-symmetrical! We'll make it symmetrical with `blot()`!

```{r}
blot(mat)
isSymmetric(blot(mat))
```

We can also choose to keep only the upper triangle if we wish:

```{r}
blot(mat, ut = TRUE)
```


## Installation

You can install blotr via devtools::

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("zkamvar/blotr")
```
